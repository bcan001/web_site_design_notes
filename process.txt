---- INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE: ----
1. site map (pg. 33) (process flow between pages)
2. wireframes (pg. 37) (show important elements and functionality such as dropdowns/interactions, etc.)
3. usability diagrams (pg. 41) (combination of site map and wireframe, illustrates the path a user may take. May even have off-site actions, such as email sendouts)
4. prototypes (pg. 43) (working models of site features. will be 'skinned' by a designer once completed, which means adding a design on top of a working model. PROVIDE PROOF OF CONCEPT)
 - design prototypes: visual concept brainstorming (pg. 45) (mood boards, style tiles(ctp), metaphors


---- SITE DESIGN: ----
PLAN (pg. 51):
5. Usability: can the user find what they need to, and easily?

Navigation (links pages to each other, the cornerstone of web site usability): 
 4 states to an item in the navigation bar:
  1. doormant/static state
  2. active state (the current page)
  3. rollover state (which is sometimes the same as the active state)
  4. visited state (indicates to the user what has already been visited)

Breadcrumbs: help give the user an overview of the site architecture
